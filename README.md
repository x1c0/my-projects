Welcome! This repository contains the source code for my personal portfolio website, built to showcase web applications I create for fun and learning. It's designed to highlight projects inspired by real-life use cases and everyday challenges.

This project itself is built using **React**, **Vite**, and **Tailwind CSS** (v4 with CSS variables).
